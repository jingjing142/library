# library

As part of the Odin Project, I created a library application with HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript. 
Users can add books, delete books, toggle the read/unread status, and filter books based on their status.
The new book form includes form validation: it displays an error message when either title or author are missing, 
and a success message when the book was successfully added.
